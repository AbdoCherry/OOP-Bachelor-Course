# Task 2

We want to find out how man employess from the Engineers and Admins (not
Manager or Directors) are in which department
Every department has itÂ´s own Manager, there not more than one Manager each
department

     By the lambda expression below we group by our department and assign each
         department the sum of the occurence departments

          Same functionality like
          EXCEL => "countif" or
          SQL => SELECT "COLUMN", COUNT(*) FROM "TABLE_NAME" GROUP BY "COLUMN" or
          Python Pandas => df.groupby(['col1', 'col2']).mean() <= (sum(), min(), max())
