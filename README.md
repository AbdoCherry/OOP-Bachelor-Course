# Full Java Course

## Abstract:
This repository contains all assignments and solutions for the course Object-Oriented Programming [__OOP__](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) from the study program International Business Information Systems (Bachelor of Science) at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. All assignments and their solutions are divided into sections / weeks. Each week contains important subdivisions of the Java programming language. 

The individual tasks are described in detail in the source code with the help of comments in order to better understand the programming steps.

It is possible to follow the course with no previous knowledge of Java. However, a basic understanding is recommended. Because this is __not a Java Tutorial__.

3. Conclusion & About me
## 1. Start, Installing Environment & Workspace
### 1.1.) Installing Java SDK
First of all you have to install the Java SDK from the official Website [__Oracle__](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Assure to download the correct executable file for your operating system, follow the installation instructions and accept the terms of condition. 

After the installation you have to add the __JAVA_HOME Variable__ to your environment variable of your operation variables. Follow the instruction linked on separate websites below or follow instruction by a youtube tutorial of your choice.

- Setting JAVA_HOME to environment variable [__Oracle-Instruction__](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html) 
### 1.2.) Installing IDE / Code Editor
You can choose every code editor or IDE you desire. Check the list below of the most common IDE´s for Java development:
- [__Eclipse__](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [__IntelliJ IDEA__](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [__Visual Studio Code__](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Editor)

All proposed applications are for free or do have at least free (community) versions. In case you choose an editor like VS Code you have to install additionally the java package plugin.

Also you will find all necessary support in installation and setting up the editor / ide massively online like youtube or the documentation of the ide´s themselfe.

## 2. Advanced Steps (not mandatory for this course)
Keep in mind that section is not important to follow up this course. You don not need any of these topics, but round the offer of information it is really recommended to have a sight on the listed topics below.

Please do not start with any topic in this section. Eventually for version control system you can make an exception and install it first, but do not waste too much time on git. Even if it is not that hard, it could be a burden for the understanding of complete beginners.
### 2.1.) Installing Version Control System
This is not necessary and in case you neve had any experience in programming you can skip this step.
But if you want to have this additional skill you can install [__git__](https://git-scm.com) as your version control system. The most needed commands will be supported by your IDE and if you want to learn more about it, just check some tutorials on the internet.

At least when you start programming in a team, which is really common in enterprise coding level, you will not have a possibility to move around version control systems. And git is the most common, most used and best developed version-control system. 

But as mentioned, you do not need it necessarly for this course. But it will help you in case you need to rollback to previous snapshot or steps in your coding progress.
### 2.2.) Build-Tools
Java-Build-Tools support the programmer in a project-management environment. The testing, packaging __(jar / war)__ -Files, handling with dependencies and adding more structure is supported by the most common buld-tools like [__Maven__](https://maven.apache.org) or [__Gradle__](https://gradle.org).
### 2.3.) Spring-Boot
This framework extends the support which you get from java-build-tools. In fact it includes the build-tools and extends them with a more common structure. 
All enterprise developed java applications where built mostly with Spring Boot as a framework. Theoretically you can rebuild it by your own and structure all folders and files like the framework, but why reinventing the wheel when it is made for you.
### 2.3.) Code Completion
To simplify your coding exercises and using your IDE/Editor more efficiently you can search for the code completion tool of your choice.
I highly recommend the AI assisted free version of [__TabNine__](https://www.tabnine.com/). Of course you can select the desirable options like,
- [__Kite__](https://www.kite.com/)
- [__GitHub-Copilot__](https://github.com/features/copilot)
Of course every one of them has a built-in plugin which has to be installed on your IDE/Editor, just like the Java Extension Package in Section 1.2)
It is not a must have but a very nice to have tool during your journey through the exercises

## 3 Conclusion & About me

### 3.1.) Conclusion
All Tasks are completed and ready to use. Feel free to use parts of it for personal or educational purposes. 
Please also refer that some tasks are not solved conventionally as you would do it as a beginner. Hopefully you gain more knowledge about java and take in count that there is not a solution for one problem to solve via coding. In reality there are many ways which lead to success and solving complex problems.

### 3.2.) Task description
Every week has it´s own readme file which summarizes all tasks. The task description is kept shortly, structured but detailed enough to understand the requirements of the problem to solve.
Keep in mind, that some parts could be confusing because the task description were translated from german to english. But in total you should understand every task.

### 3.3.) About me
I´ve started studying Business Informatics Systems at the University of applied Sciences in Frankfurt (Germany) and accomplished my Bachelor of Science Degree on this study program. After all I have continued my study for the master degree program at the University of Mannheim during my employment as a full-time DevOps & Cloud Engineer.
