# Full Java Course

## Abstract:
This repository contains all assignments and solutions for the course Object-Oriented Programming [__OOP__](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) from the study program International Business Information Systems (Bachelor of Science) at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. All assignments and their solutions are divided into sections / weeks. Each week contains important subdivisions of the Java programming language. 

The individual tasks are described in detail in the source code with the help of comments in order to better understand the programming steps.

It is possible to take the courses with no previous knowledge of Java. However, a basic understanding is recommended. Because this is __not a Java Tutorial__.

4. Conclusion & About me
## 1. Start, Installing Environment & Workspace
### 1.1.) Installing Java SDK
First you have to install the Java SDK from the official Website [__Oracle__](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Assure to download the correct executable file for your operating system, follow the installation instructions and accept the terms of condition. 

After the installation you have to add the __JAVA_HOME Variable__ to your environment variable of your operation variables. Follow the instruction linked on separate websites below or follow instruction by a YouTube tutorial of your choice.

- Setting JAVA_HOME to environment variable [__Oracle-Instruction__](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html) 
### 1.2.) Installing IDE / Code Editor
You can choose every code editor or IDE you desire. Check the list below of the most common IDE´s for Java development:
- [__Eclipse__](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [__IntelliJ IDEA__](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [__Visual Studio Code__](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Editor)

All proposed applications are for free or do have at least free (community) versions. In case you choose an editor like VS Code you have to install additionally the java package plugin.

Also, you will find all necessary support in installation and setting up the editor / ide massively online like YouTube or the documentation of the ide´s themselfe.

## 2. Special Hints & Tipps for this Task-Collection
First, read the task carefully. Don´t exaggerate and start directly with coding when you are not sure about the way you want to solve the problem.
It is ok, if you didn´t found the ´exact´ way or most efficient solution. 

As long, you come to a result without any failure in your code you fulfilled the task and hopefully learned something. One tipp for you if you don´t know exactly how to start: Take a moment and modellize your structure. Especially when you start with the tasks which cover inheritance, generics and collections you may need a pen and paper for some preparation work. At least it helped me to continue with the tasks.
Also, one important thing, don´t give up if you´re a starter. 

It is completely normal when you frustrate in some points or other and need a break. Programming is not about to become the best, you want to become a good problem solver and programming helps you to discover a new paradigm or way of thinking.

Feel free to take additional inputs from documentations or YouTube tutorials. There are several sources of good content and input. But one hint I can give you in this is that you have to be careful not drawn in the mass of content and information. Sometimes you don´t see the forest for the trees by the immense quantity of input.

### 2.1 My best Bro-Tip
Take on some tasks a step back and do a break. You are not the first one who was struggling on some tasks like how does polymorphism works, what's the syntax of filtering an arraylist and storing the results into a hashmap. Sometimes you need to take a break, letting your progresses sink in and maybe restart your approach.

And it is not a shame to get inspired by my offered solutions in this project. By typing the code one on one your muscle memory for the syntax will get better, just don´t make it as a default during the learning and you´re fine. 
Remember, we all started somewhere and no one was born a java developer.

### 2.2 Open for critics and advises
Please don´t be shy or hesitate if you think you have a better solution. As mentioned, many solutions lead to success and that should be, at least at the beginning of your learning journey, not focused on the fastest one.
For this statement I´m highly welcoming any critics, faults, hints or better solutions than mine. I would be very thankful. Just push an issue on GitHub.  

## 3. Advanced Steps (not mandatory for this course)
Keep in mind that section is not important to follow up this course. You do not need any of these topics, but round the offer of information it is really recommended to have a sight on the listed topics below.

Please do not start with any topic in this section. Eventually for version control system you can make an exception and install it first, but do not waste too much time on git. Even if it is not that hard, it could be a burden for the understanding of complete beginners.
### 3.1.) Installing Version Control System
This is not necessary and in case you never had any experience in programming you can skip this step.
But if you want to have this additional skill you can install [__git__](https://git-scm.com) as your version control system. The most needed commands will be supported by your IDE and if you want to learn more about it, just check some tutorials on the internet.

At least when you start programming in a team, which is really common in enterprise coding level, you will not have a possibility to move around version control systems. And git is the most common, most used and best developed version-control system. 

But as mentioned, you do not need it necessarly for this course. But it will help you in case you need to rollback to previous snapshot or steps in your coding progress.
### 3.2.) Build-Tools
Java-Build-Tools support the programmer in a project-management environment. The testing, packaging __(jar / war)__ -Files, handling with dependencies and adding more structure is supported by the most common buld-tools like [__Maven__](https://maven.apache.org) or [__Gradle__](https://gradle.org).
### 3.3.) Spring-Boot
This framework extends the support which you get from java-build-tools. In fact, it includes the build-tools and extends them with a more common structure. 
All enterprise developed java applications where built mostly with Spring Boot as a framework. Theoretically you can rebuild it by your own and structure all folders and files like the framework, but why reinventing the wheel when it is made for you.

It also provides online an intializer which supports you to create a well-prepared spring boot folder. Just google for spring boot initializer, and you will find the it in the first results, or use it directly from the offered functions on your desired ide.
### 3.3.) Code Completion
To simplify your coding exercises and using your IDE/Editor more efficiently you can search for the code completion tool of your choice.
I highly recommend the AI assisted free version of [__TabNine__](https://www.tabnine.com/). Of course, you can select the desirable options like,
- [__Kite__](https://www.kite.com/)
- [__GitHub-Copilot__](https://github.com/features/copilot)

Of course every one of them has a built-in plugin which has to be installed on your IDE/Editor, just like the Java Extension Package in Section 1.2)
It is not a must-have but a very nice to have tooled during your journey through the exercises

## 4 Conclusion & About me

### 4.1.) Conclusion
All Tasks are completed and ready to use. Feel free to use parts of it for personal or educational purposes. 
Please also refer that some tasks are not solved conventionally as you would do it as a beginner. Hopefully you gain more knowledge about java and take in count that there is not a solution for one problem to solve via coding. In reality there are many ways which lead to success and solving complex issues.

### 4.2.) About me
I´ve started studying International Business Informatics Systems at the University of applied Sciences in Frankfurt (Germany) and accomplished my Bachelor of Science Degree on this study program. After all I have continued my study for the master degree program at the University of Mannheim during my employment as a full-time DevOps & Cloud Engineer.

- Data Science & Machine Learning with **Python** ![__Python__](python.png)
- WebApp Developement and Web-Desing with **Angular** and **Java** ![**Angular**](angular.png) & ![__Java__](java.png)

I hope that my input could encourage a few people to start a career as a developer. Please left some comments or questions if you wish, I´m always going to look to improve my skills and the best way to do so, is to get input from you.
