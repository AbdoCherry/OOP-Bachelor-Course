# Task collection of Week 9

## Task 01:
Write a programme that indicates for a certain year whether the year is a leap year, outputs the number of days per month and indicates which day of the year is 1st May.

You can enter the year for which this evaluation is to be carried out yourself.

## Task 02:
You are entrusted with a project in which the logic of a bank is to be implemented.

The bank software supports the creation of term deposit accounts (time deposit accounts). With this type of account, withdrawals are only possible after a certain maturity date.

To do this, create the two __Classes Customer__ and __Deposit Account__. The Class Customer includes the attributes name, firstname, customerNo, customerSince and the methods addAccount and getAccount. The Deposit Account class includes the following attributes: description, accountStd, investmentDate and dueDate. It also has the methods withdraw(), deposit() and getDescription(). With the getDescription() method, in addition to the specification of the due date, you also receive the text "term deposit account".

## Task 03:
Write a programme that is passed two words as parameters when the programme is called (via arguments).
The two words are then displayed on the screen.

If only one word was entered, the error message: "**** one more parameter missed !" should be displayed.
If no word was entered, the error message: "**** parameters missed !" should be displayed.
