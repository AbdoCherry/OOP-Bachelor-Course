# Task collection of Week 2

## Task 01:
Create a youth protection program that decides, depending on the age of the youth, which goods the youth is allowed to buy: Beer and wine from 16 years old, liquor from 18. The under 16s should not get any alcohol at all.
As a result, the console displays what all he is allowed to drink or not.

The value for the alter parameter is passed as a command line argument when the parental control program is called.
Part of the task is that you try to use different types of control structures to learn to assess their advantages and disadvantages !

## Task 02:
Write a program that calculates the vacation entitlement of employees depending on the entered length of membership in the company. The vacation entitlement is defined as follows:

__Length of affiliation Entitlement__

| Affiliation	 | Entitled to	 |
|--------------|--------------|
| 1 Year 	     | 	    15      |
| 2-3 Years	   | 20 	         |
| 4-5 Years 	  | 25 	         |
|6 or more years | 30 |

The value of the company affiliation is passed as a transfer parameter in the form of command line arguments when the program is called. Part of the task is that you try to use different types of control structures to learn to assess their advantages and disadvantages !


## Task 03:
Write a program that reads three variables for principal value, interest rate, and a term (<= 7 years) from the keyboard during program execution.
Create a compound interest table in which the sum value of the principal value and the accrued interest is output after each year of the term.

## Task 04:
Write a program that reads account balances from the keyboard during program execution. Account balances above 100€ are displayed as read. For account balances less than or equal to 100€, the difference amount to 100€ is calculated and output with the following message: Input error ! - Shortfall: < difference amount >.

## Task 05:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a grade in the form of an integer from 1 to 6. The grade value is entered during program execution.
Depending on the note value entered, the program then outputs the note in text form, i.e.: "very good", "good", etc.
Provide also for wrong input of note values.

After that the program should wait again for input of a note value.
Only when the user enters "N", the program will end.

Part of the task is that you try to use different types of control structures to learn to assess their advantages and disadvantages !

## Task 06:
Write a program that adds VAT to the Euro amount to be entered by the user and outputs the total amount in Euro and USD (exchange rate: 1 Euro equals 1.0971 USD).

Use one method each (function or routine!) for calculating VAT and currency conversion.

## Task 07:
Mr. Schmidt would like to make his car purchase decision, whether to buy a car with a diesel or gasoline engine, from an economic point of view.

The following conditions are assumed:
Gasoline vehicle: Acquisition value 25000€, tax 125€ annually, gasoline consumption 8.6l/100km.
Diesel vehicle: Acquisition value 28500€, tax 310€ annually, diesel consumption 6,4l/100km.
Let the gasoline price per liter be 1,31€ and the diesel price per liter be 1,12€.
Create a program that shows the cost from purchase, added tax and added fuel consumption per car over 6 years if:

- the annual mileage is 17000 km
- the annual mileage is 25000 km

The annual mileage is to be read from the keyboard during the program execution.
The result of the evaluation is to be represented in an output form as clear as possible.

Use the concept of the method in the programming if possible! Option: The solution can be further flexibilized by entering purchase value, annual tax, gasoline/diesel consumption also during program execution.
