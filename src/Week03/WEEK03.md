# Task collection of Week 3

## Task 01:

Write a program that reads 6 arbitrary account balances with 2 decimal places of a customer from the console into an
array and then outputs the array and additionally once more the account balances of the 3rd and 5th array element.

## Task 02:

Write a program that is passed two words as transfer parameters in the form of command line arguments when the program
is called.
Both words are then output on the screen.

If only one word was entered, the error message: "**** one more parameter missed !" should be displayed.
If no word was entered, the error message: "**** parameters missed !" should be displayed.

## Task 03:

Calculate the minimum, maximum and average value for 5 stock prices read in for program execution.
Test your program for correctness with the following test cases: 1. the largest value is entered as the first value

2. the largest value is entered as the last value
3. the largest value is entered several times
4. the largest value is extremely large compared to the other values
5. enter only 0 as values
6. enter as values only the number 4711
   Output the account balances as well as the calculated results on the console.

## Task 04:

Modify the program of task 4 in such a way that the calculation of minimum, maximum and the mean value is realized by
one method each.

## Task 05:

Write a program again that calculates the vacation entitlement of the employees depending on the entered affiliation
with the company.
Now solve the problem using an array ! The vacation entitlement is defined as follows:

__Length of affiliation Entitlement__

| Affiliation     | Entitled to |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 Year          | 15          |
| 2-3 Years       | 20          |
| 4-5 Years       | 25          |
| 6 or more years | 30          |

## Task 06:

Write a program that outputs the first 128 characters of the UTF code, i.e. the ASCII characters.
In a 2nd step, modify your program so that only all uppercase letters and their code are output.

## Task 07:

Write a simple program for text encryption. For this purpose, each letter of a message is to be shifted by a fixed value
n according to the following examples:

For example, if n=2, A is shifted to C, B is shifted to D, and Z is shifted to B. Digits and special characters are not
shifted.

Input parameters are the word to be encoded and the number n that specifies the shift. Both parameters are passed during
program execution (class Scanner).
