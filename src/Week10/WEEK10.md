# Task collection of Week 10

## Task 01:
Write an application that accepts an arbitrary, unsorted sequence of numbers via keyboard and sorts and outputs them in ascending order.
Use different types of collections to gain experience with their handling!

## Task 02:
In week 7 you built a class hierarchy Employee with base class Employee and the derived classes Manager, Director, Engineer and Admin. 
Simplify this hierarchy by combining the two derived __Classes Engineer__ and __Admin__ into one __Class Employees__.
To be able to manage the assigned employees, extend the Manager class with the two attributes staff and employeeCount.

Then add the methods findEmployee(), addEmployee(), removeEmployee().
The method findEmployee() checks whether the employee is already assigned. If a match is found, return the index number, otherwise 1.
Finally, extend the class with the method displayStaff(). 

This method returns the name of the manager as well as all subordinate employees.
To check your implementation, write a corresponding test programme. You can freely choose the data for defining further employees.

## Task 03:
Create an application that translates a word into another language after input. The word is to translate the searched term from German to English and vice versa and output it on the console.

If the word exists in both English and German, they are to be output recognisably with their respective translation into the other language.
The application's vocabulary should know at least 10 German and 10 English words, including at least two "false friends" (same word, different meaning).

<i>Of course you can use here other languages of your choice</i>

## Task 04:
Create a data structure that records the driving times of various test drives for different vehicles. 
For this purpose, the vehicle and the driving times achieved are to be managed in detail.

After some vehicles have been recorded, the programme should repeatedly record the driving times for individual vehicles and enter them accordingly in the above data structure.
It should be possible to display the list of driving times achieved on the test drives for individual vehicles.
